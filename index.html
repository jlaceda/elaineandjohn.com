	<p>this baby is going to CHANGE OUR WORLD FOREVER! come celebrate this upcoming LIFE CHANGING addition to our fledgling family with your family. you should have gotten an invite with a time and place for this gathering. if you have not, then yodel your information request from the highest hilltop of the land and we will respond to you via carrier pigeon. or <a href="mailto:john.laceda+baby@gmail.com,ealasagas+baby@gmail.com?subject=BABY SHOWER INQUIRY">email</a> us.</p>
	<p>as for gifts, your presence is present enough for us :) but because of the social contract of a baby shower dictates you should probably bring something, here are options: 
		<ul>
			<li>if you have a lightly used baby/toddler toy/clothing that you can part with, please use that as your gift for us instead of buying something new. some of our close friends have already done this and we greatly appreciate them for it.</li>
			<li>we have online registries of baby things on amazon and target
